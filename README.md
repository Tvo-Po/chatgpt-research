The <code>programming</code> directory contains subdirectories for different programming languages, including <code>general</code>, <code>javascript</code>, and <code>python</code>.<br/>

Within the <code>general</code> directory, there are two subdirectories, <code>grpc-parcing</code> and <code>pattern-sourcing</code>, each containing a file named <code>chat.md</code>. These files likely contain chats related to specific programming topics, such as parsing with gRPC or sourcing patterns.<br/>

The <code>javascript</code> directory contains three subdirectories, <code>assist-with-react-app</code>, <code>customizing-chart</code>, and <code>scss-component-selector</code>, each containing a file named <code>chat.md</code>.
